Accident at Watsonville pit Dalziel Motherwell<br>
25th April 1879.
 

From Main body of report: At Watsonville, on the 25th April, two colliers, father and son, were told by the fireman that he had found a little fire-damp in their place, and that he would go in before them and expel it. They did not wait but went in to commence work. On reaching within 8 yards of the face they left their naked lights and one of them went in the dark and began to "waff''' out the gas; in doing so it was driven upon their open lights, where it ignited and burned them.

Died of his injuries a week later 2nd May
Son William died 5 weeks later, 30th May
