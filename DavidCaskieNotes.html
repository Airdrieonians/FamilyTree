From Main body of report: <br>
At Watsonville, on the 25th April,<br>
two colliers, father and son, <br>
were told by the fireman that he had found a little fire-damp in their place, <br>
and that he would go in before them and expel it. <br>
They did not wait but went in to commence work.<br>
On reaching within 8 yards of the face they left their naked lights <br>
and one of them went in the dark and began to "waff''' out the gas;<br>
in doing so it was driven upon their open lights,<br>
where it ignited and burned them.<br>
